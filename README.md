# Java Exercises - My Programming Journey ☕

Welcome to my study repository! This space was created to store the solutions for exercises and challenges I complete while learning Java.

## 🎯 Objective
My main goal with this repository is to document my constant evolution as a programmer, consolidating concepts of Programming Logic, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and development best practices.

Each line of code here represents a step toward my goal of becoming an increasingly skilled Java Developer.

## 📚 Technologies
- **Java** (JDK)
- **Git** for version control
- **IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code**
